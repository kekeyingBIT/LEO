For perfect backhaul case, run the main function  “Sim_Fig9.m” to start the simulation. To plot_figure, load  “1000th.mat”  and run “plotSim.m”, you get the results in Fig. 9. For other figures in Perfect Backhaul, the main body of the function is the same and you only need to modify the simulated parameters accordingly.

For quantized backhaul case, run the main function  “Sim_Fig14.m” to start the simulation. To plot_figure, load  “500th.mat”  and run “plotSim.m”, you get the results in Fig. 14. For other figures in Quantized Backhaul, the main body of the function is the same and you only need to modify the simulated parameters accordingly.
